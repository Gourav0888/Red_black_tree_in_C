# ðŸŒ³ Red-Black Tree Implementation in C

This project implements a **Red-Black Tree** in C, a self-balancing Binary Search Tree that ensures operations like insertion, deletion, and search are done efficiently in **O(log n)** time.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

The tree supports the following operations:

1. **Insert Data** â€“ Adds a node while maintaining Red-Black balancing rules.
2. **Delete Data** â€“ Removes a node with proper tree rebalancing.
3. **Find Minimum Data** â€“ Retrieves the smallest element in the tree.
4. **Delete Minimum Data** â€“ Removes the smallest node.
5. **Find Maximum Data** â€“ Retrieves the largest element in the tree.
6. **Delete Maximum Data** â€“ Removes the largest node.
7. **Search Data** â€“ Searches for a specific value in the tree.
8. **Display Tree** â€“ Prints the tree structure in a readable format.
